## CEMLI Framework

Oracle CEMLI is an acronym that stands for **Configuration**, **Extension**, **Modification**, **Localization**, and **Integration**. These are the five types of customizations that can be made to an Oracle application.

The CEMLI framework is a set of guidelines for managing customizations to Oracle applications. It provides a structured approach to customizing an Oracle application to meet the specific needs of an organization while maintaining the integrity and stability of the core application.

The CEMLI framework is based on five types of customizations: Configuration, Extension, Modification, Localization, and Integration. Each type of customization is distinct and requires a different approach, skillset, and level of effort.
