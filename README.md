## CEMLI Overview

**Oracle CEMLI** is an acronym for the five customizations that can be made to an Oracle application: **Configuration**, **Extension**, **Modification**, **Localization**, and **Integration**.

**The CEMLI framework** provides a structured approach to customizing Oracle applications to meet an organization's business requirements. It offers guidelines for managing customizations to the application while maintaining its integrity and stability.

**The CEMLI framework** provides guidelines for customizing Oracle applications, documenting customizations, and testing before deployment. By following the CEMLI framework, organizations can reduce the risk of system disruptions, make upgrades more effortless, and better align their Oracle applications with business requirements. The framework is designed to provide a standard approach to customizing Oracle applications, enabling organizations to make necessary changes without disrupting the underlying systems.

**The CEMLI framework** benefits industries with unique business requirements that out-of-the-box Oracle applications may not meet. Every type of customization is distinct and requires a different approach, skill set, and level of effort. The CEMLI framework provides guidelines for managing each customization type while maintaining consistency and repeatability.

## CEMLI History

**Oracle Corporation** introduced the CEMLI framework in the late 2000s to help organizations manage customizations to their Oracle applications. Before its introduction, customizations to Oracle applications were often made ad hoc, leading to a fragmented and unstable system that was difficult to maintain and upgrade. The CEMLI framework provided guidelines for managing customizations and emphasized the importance of following a structured approach, focusing on the five types of customizations: Configuration, Extension, Modification, Localization, and Integration.

**The CEMLI framework** was initially defined in Oracle's E-Business Suite and was later expanded to include other Oracle applications, such as PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, and Siebel CRM. Today, the CEMLI framework is widely used by organizations worldwide that use Oracle applications, and it has become a best practice in the industry for managing customizations to enterprise software.

The history of **Oracle CEMLI** dates back to the early days of Oracle's development of enterprise software applications. The need for customizations to meet specific business needs increasing as the Oracle software suite grew more extensive and complex. To address this need, Oracle introduced the CEMLI framework, which has since become an essential tool in Oracle's application development and customization process.

**The CEMLI framework** continues to evolve as new technologies emerge and Oracle expands its software offerings. It is a vital tool for organizations that need to customize their Oracle applications to meet their unique business requirements while minimizing the risk of system disruptions and maintaining the integrity of their core applications.

### Configuration

Configuration in the CEMLI Framework refers to adjusting an Oracle application's settings and parameters to align with an organization's business requirements. This type of customization typically involves setting up user roles and permissions, defining approval workflows, and configuring accounting rules. It focuses on modifying an application's setup or configuration settings to meet specific business needs, such as changing default language settings or customizing the user interface. Using the Configuration approach, organizations can tailor the application to their specific requirements while minimizing the risk of disrupting the underlying system's stability and integrity.

#### Examples

- Setting up a new responsibility in Oracle E-Business Suite
- Configuring a new printer for printing invoices in Oracle Fusion Applications
- Modifying the default currency in Oracle Cloud ERP
- Setting up a new employee in Oracle HRMS with a new job and position.
- Defining a new organization in Oracle Inventory Management to manage inventory at a new location.
- Configuring a new payment term in Oracle Payables to support payment for a new vendor.
