## CEMLI Framework

Oracle CEMLI is an acronym that stands for **Configuration**, **Extension**, **Modification**, **Localization**, and **Integration**. These are the five types of customizations that can be made to an Oracle application.

The CEMLI framework is a set of guidelines for managing customizations to Oracle applications. It provides a structured approach to customizing an Oracle application to meet the specific needs of an organization while maintaining the integrity and stability of the core application.

The CEMLI framework is based on five types of customizations: Configuration, Extension, Modification, Localization, and Integration. Each type of customization is distinct and requires a different approach, skillset, and level of effort.

Here is an overview of the CEMLI framework:

- **Configuration**: This involves making changes to an Oracle application's settings and parameters to align it with an organization's business requirements. Configuration typically involves setting up user roles and permissions, defining approval workflows, and configuring accounting rules.
- **Extension**: An extension is a custom development that adds new functionality to an Oracle application. Extensions can be developed using Oracle's proprietary development tools, such as Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports, or using other development platforms, such as Java or .NET.
- **Modification**: A modification involves changing the code or database schema of an Oracle application to meet specific business requirements. Modifications are typically more complex and require advanced programming skills.
- **Localization**: Localization involves adapting an Oracle application to meet the language and cultural requirements of a specific region or country. This can include translating the user interface, formatting date and time fields, and accommodating local tax laws and regulations.
- **Integration**: Integration involves connecting an Oracle application to other systems and applications within an organization. This can include integrating with third-party software, such as a customer relationship management (CRM) system or an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, or integrating with other Oracle applications.

The CEMLI framework provides a structured approach to managing customizations to Oracle applications. By following the guidelines of the framework, organizations can ensure that their customizations are aligned with their business requirements and are properly integrated with the core application.
