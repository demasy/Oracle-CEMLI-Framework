## CEMLI History

**Oracle Corporation** introduced the CEMLI framework in the late 2000s to help organizations manage customizations to their Oracle applications. Before its introduction, customizations to Oracle applications were often made ad hoc, leading to a fragmented and unstable system that was difficult to maintain and upgrade. The CEMLI framework provided guidelines for managing customizations and emphasized the importance of following a structured approach, focusing on the five types of customizations: Configuration, Extension, Modification, Localization, and Integration.

**The CEMLI framework** was initially defined in Oracle's E-Business Suite and was later expanded to include other Oracle applications, such as PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, and Siebel CRM. Today, the CEMLI framework is widely used by organizations worldwide that use Oracle applications, and it has become a best practice in the industry for managing customizations to enterprise software.

The history of **Oracle CEMLI** dates back to the early days of Oracle's development of enterprise software applications. The need for customizations to meet specific business needs increasing as the Oracle software suite grew more extensive and complex. To address this need, Oracle introduced the CEMLI framework, which has since become an essential tool in Oracle's application development and customization process.

**The CEMLI framework** continues to evolve as new technologies emerge and Oracle expands its software offerings. It is a vital tool for organizations that need to customize their Oracle applications to meet their unique business requirements while minimizing the risk of system disruptions and maintaining the integrity of their core applications.

### Configuration

Configuration in the CEMLI Framework refers to adjusting an Oracle application's settings and parameters to align with an organization's business requirements. This type of customization typically involves setting up user roles and permissions, defining approval workflows, and configuring accounting rules. It focuses on modifying an application's setup or configuration settings to meet specific business needs, such as changing default language settings or customizing the user interface. Using the Configuration approach, organizations can tailor the application to their specific requirements while minimizing the risk of disrupting the underlying system's stability and integrity.

#### Examples

- Setting up a new responsibility in Oracle E-Business Suite
- Configuring a new printer for printing invoices in Oracle Fusion Applications
- Modifying the default currency in Oracle Cloud ERP
- Setting up a new employee in Oracle HRMS with a new job and position.
- Defining a new organization in Oracle Inventory Management to manage inventory at a new location.
- Configuring a new payment term in Oracle Payables to support payment for a new vendor.

<br>

### Extension

The extension part of the CEMLI framework involves adding new features or functions to an Oracle application to meet an organization's specific business requirements. This typically involves developing new code by modifying or creating new code from scratch.

Extensions can be implemented using various development tools like Oracle Application Framework (OAF), Oracle Forms, or Oracle Reports. Extensions can add new functionality to an application, such as custom workflows, new reports, or additional fields to capture data.

Extensions made using the CEMLI framework are designed to be maintainable and upgradeable, meaning that they can be easily modified or updated when new releases of the Oracle application become available. This ensures that customizations do not become obsolete and can continue to provide value to the organization over time.

#### Examples

- Adding a custom report to Oracle E-Business Suite to display order information in a specific format
- Developing a custom web page in Oracle Application Express to allow customers to submit service requests
- Creating a custom workflow in Oracle Cloud HCM to automate the onboarding process for new employees
- Adding a new custom report in Oracle General Ledger to display financial information in a specific format.
- Developing a custom form in Oracle Forms to capture additional information about customer orders.
- Creating a custom workflow in Oracle Workflow to automate the approval process for purchase requisitions.

<br>

### Modification

Modification is altering or customizing an existing Oracle application's functionality to meet an organization's specific requirements. It involves changing the application's underlying code, database structure, or user interface. Modifications may include adding new fields to a form, creating new reports, or changing the behavior of existing functions. It is important to note that modifications may impact the application's future upgrades, making it essential to carefully evaluate the impact of any changes before implementing them.

#### Examples

- Modifying the standard invoice validation process in Oracle E-Business Suite to include additional checks.
- Changing the default inventory valuation method in Oracle Fusion Applications to align with specific accounting rules.
