## CEMLI Framework

Oracle CEMLI is an acronym that stands for **Configuration**, **Extension**, **Modification**, **Localization**, and **Integration**. These are the five types of customizations that can be made to an Oracle application.

The CEMLI framework is a set of guidelines for managing customizations to Oracle applications. It provides a structured approach to customizing an Oracle application to meet the specific needs of an organization while maintaining the integrity and stability of the core application.

The CEMLI framework is based on five types of customizations: Configuration, Extension, Modification, Localization, and Integration. Each type of customization is distinct and requires a different approach, skillset, and level of effort.

Here is an overview of the CEMLI framework:

- **Configuration**: This involves making changes to an Oracle application's settings and parameters to align it with an organization's business requirements. Configuration typically involves setting up user roles and permissions, defining approval workflows, and configuring accounting rules.
- **Extension**: An extension is a custom development that adds new functionality to an Oracle application. Extensions can be developed using Oracle's proprietary development tools, such as Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports, or using other development platforms, such as Java or .NET.
- **Modification**: A modification involves changing the code or database schema of an Oracle application to meet specific business requirements. Modifications are typically more complex and require advanced programming skills.
- **Localization**: Localization involves adapting an Oracle application to meet the language and cultural requirements of a specific region or country. This can include translating the user interface, formatting date and time fields, and accommodating local tax laws and regulations.
- **Integration**: Integration involves connecting an Oracle application to other systems and applications within an organization. This can include integrating with third-party software, such as a customer relationship management (CRM) system or an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, or integrating with other Oracle applications.

The CEMLI framework provides a structured approach to managing customizations to Oracle applications. By following the guidelines of the framework, organizations can ensure that their customizations are aligned with their business requirements and are properly integrated with the core application.

## Complexity Level
The complexity level of CEMLI customizations can vary depending on the type of customization and the specific requirements of the organization. Here's a general overview of the complexity level of each type of customization:

- **Configuration**: Configuration is typically the least complex type of customization, as it involves making changes to an Oracle application's settings and parameters using the built-in tools provided by the application. However, even with configuration, there can be complexity in the choices made during configuration, the number of options and workflows to consider, and the impact of changes on the overall system.
- **Extension**: Extensions can be moderately complex depending on the functionality being added and the development platform being used. Developing an extension requires an understanding of the Oracle application's architecture and the programming skills to create the custom functionality.
- **Modification**: Modifications are typically the most complex type of customization, as they involve changing the code or database schema of an Oracle application. This requires advanced programming skills and a deep understanding of the Oracle application's architecture. Modifications can be risky, as they can impact the stability and upgradeability of the core application.
- **Localization**: Localization can range in complexity depending on the number of languages and regions being supported, the complexity of the legal and regulatory requirements, and the level of customization required to meet those requirements. It can involve translating the user interface, adapting workflows, and modifying reports to accommodate local requirements.
- **Integration**: Integration can range in complexity depending on the systems being integrated and the level of data exchange required. Integrating with third-party software can involve working with different data formats, protocols, and security requirements, and may require custom development to establish the integration.

Overall, the complexity level of CEMLI customizations depends on the specific requirements of the organization and the type of customization being performed. It is important to carefully evaluate the complexity and potential risks of each customization before proceeding, and to engage the necessary expertise and resources to ensure a successful outcome.
